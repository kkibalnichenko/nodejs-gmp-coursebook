# Node.js Global Mentoring Program
Welcome to the Node.js Global Mentoring Program ðŸš€

This repository contains all the content related to program. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as platform to document the modules.

There are 2 sub-folders:
- `/Modules` - contains the content of the book itself (there is a separate folder for each module, e.g `/docs/1-Intro`)
- `/Homework` - contains examples of solutions for home tasks

## Run the book

Follow the instructions below:

```
cd Modules
npm i
npm start // the book will be available by http://localhost:3000
```

## Contribute
If you find any typo or think that something could be improved, feel free to clone this repo and open a `Merge Request`. The team will be glad to review and merge it.
