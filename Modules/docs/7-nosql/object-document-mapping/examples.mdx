## [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)

:::info
Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
:::

### Requirements
- Installed NodeJS
- MongoDB on your machine or use the MongoDB cloud
- Installed ```mongoose``` npm package to your project

### Before start

- Before use ODM, create your first database in MongoDB. Then, create your first collection (Example - ```User```).
- Create file ```index.js``` in your project.

## Step 1

- Include ```mongoose``` in your project
- Open a connection to the created database. [How to connect](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html)

```js
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');

  mongoose.connect("YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING");
```

## Step 2

- Create database schema using ```mongoose```. [About schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)
- Create new model using this schema. [About model](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)

```js
  const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  const userSchema = new Schema({
      name: String,
      age: Number
  });

  const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```
[Schemas types](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html) for ```mongoose```.
When we created ```User``` model, it means that ```mongoose``` will automatically look for your created collection.
Now, you are able to work with this collection.

## Step 3

- Create new model entity
- Save this entity into DB. [Model API])(https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html)
- Close connection to DB

```js
  const user = new User({
      name: "Name",
      age: 18
  });

  user.save()
  .then((entity) => {
      console.log(entity);
      mongoose.disconnect();
  })
  .catch((error) => {
      console.log(error);
      mongoose.disconnect();
  });
```
