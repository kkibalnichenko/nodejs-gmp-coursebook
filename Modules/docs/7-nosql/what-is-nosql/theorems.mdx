### Overview

In previous module you have learned ACID principles of database transactions. <br/>
We need other sets of rules and theorems around the distributed systems.
There come CAP and BASE.


### CAP
According to the CAP theorem, the system can be either Available or Consistent in the event of a network partition.

- ```C```onsistency: <br/>
Data should be sequential consistent.
Refers to linearizability across all nodes of a distributed system.
All nodes in a system return same data after a successful write operation.
- ```A```vailability: <br/>
Every request served by a non-failing node must result in a response in a reasonable amount of time.
- ```P```artition tolerance: <br/>
In the case of partition failure, system will continue to work and provide consistent data.


### BASE

- ```B```asically ```A```vailable: <br/>
Writing and reading operations are available as much as possible even if itâ€™s a failure.
- ```S```oft State: <br/>
No guarantees that the data eventually becomes consistent.
- ```E```ventual Consistency <br/>
The components in the system may not reflect the same value/state of a record at a given point in time.
They will settle it eventually.
