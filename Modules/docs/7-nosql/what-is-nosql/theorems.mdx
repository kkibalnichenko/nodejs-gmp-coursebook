### Overview



### CAP

- ```C```onsistency: Data should be sequential consistent(refers to linearizability across all nodes of a distributed system, such that all nodes in a system return same data after a successful write operation.
- ```A```vailability: Every request served by a non-failing node must result in a response in a reasonable amount of time.
- ```P```artition tolerance: In the case of partition failure, System will continue to work and provide consistent data.


### BASE

- ```B```asically ```A```vailable. Writing and reading operations are available as much as possible even if it’s a failure.
- ```S```oft State. No guarantees that the data eventually becomes consistent.
- ```E```ventual Consistency. The components in the system may not reflect the same value/state of a record at a given point in time. They will settle it eventually.

### ACID

- ```A```tomicity. Only the specified data is affected by an operation.
- ```C```onsistency. Each operation moves the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.
- ```I```solation. One operation does not affect other concurrent operations.
- ```D```urability. Once written, a transaction’s updates should not be lost.
