## Overview

:::info History
The acronym `NoSQL` was first used in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi while naming his lightweight, open-source "relational" database that did not use SQL.
The name came up again in 2009 when Eric Evans and Johan Oskarsson used it to describe non-relational databases.<br/>
:::

NoSQL means either `No SQL systems` or more commonly - `Not only SQL`,
to focus on the fact some systems might support SQL-like query languages.
Unlike SQL, NoSQL does not store data in a relational format.
The data does not need to have a strict schema nor the usual SQL table structure.
However, not applying a schema at the data entry point
also means it is more difficult to query NoSQL databases, maintain data consistency,
and establish relationships between data sets.
Before going further, let's understand what is structured and unstructured data.

### Structured data

- Clearly defined
- Has predefined formats
- Easy to search and analyze

### Unstructured data

- Stored in its native format
- Requires more work to process and understand.

## Use Cases

### Session Store

NoSQL can be used as a global session store, which manages session information for user.

### Content Management

Content management can store information in any format including text, images, audio and video.
NoSQL offers a better option for storing multimedia content with flexible and open-ended data model.

### Big Data Processing

Big data is too large to be handled through traditional processing systems.
Real-time systems use stream processing to ingest new data while analyzing historical data.

### Internet of Things

IoT devices are connected to the internet or communications networks and they able to collect and share data without humans.
Billions of devices generating big amount of data, IoT NoSQL databases provide scalability and more flexible schema to IoT service providers.

### Mobile Applications

NoSQL is a perfect solution for businesses that deliver services on mobile devices with flexible data models
