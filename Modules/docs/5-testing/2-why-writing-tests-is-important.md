# Why writing tests is important?

Before we dive deep into testing practices in Node.js, letâ€™s start by answering the main question: why is testing so important and why should developers write tests? 

Writing tests helps you to:
1. build confidence in how your code works
2. reduce potential bugs & deliver new changes quickly
3. receive instant feedback & catch regression early
4. refactor, deploy and release with higher confidence
