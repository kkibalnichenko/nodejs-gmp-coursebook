# Practical task

You are working for a delivery company that has offices in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands. You are a part of backend team that focuses on building internal tools for that company. One day you received a new request from a customer to create a public holidays module. This module will:
- show a list of public holidays for specific country for the current year
- show the next public holiday for specific country
- show if today is public holiday in your location

After some time of investigation, you found [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html) that meets the requirements above. Your customer agreed to use it, so now you can start the development.

Once youâ€™ve finished writing code, you have to cover your module with tests. The implementation can be found [here](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/tree/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing).

## Acceptance criteria
1. [Jest](https://npmjs.com/package/jest) is used for unit and integration tests, [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) - for E2E tests.
2. The [module](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/tree/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing) is covered with tests following instructions below:
    - Unit tests are written for [public-holidays.service.ts](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/blob/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing/src/services/public-holidays.service.ts) and [helpers.ts](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/blob/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing/src/helpers.ts) files. Keep in mind that any external calls are mocked in unit tests.
    - Integration tests are written for [public-holidays.service.ts](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/blob/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing/src/services/public-holidays.service.ts). Do not forget that in this case you make real calls to the API.
    - E2E tests are written for any two endpoints from [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html). 
5. Code coverage is calculated, it is not less than 85%. Any format for the coverage report can be used.
6. The following npm scripts are added to run tests:
    - `npm test` - to run unit and integration tests
    - `npm test:e2e` - to run E2E tests
    - `npm test:coverage` - to get code coverage
