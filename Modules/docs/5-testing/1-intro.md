# Intro

Before we dive deep into testing practices in Node.js, let’s start by answering the main question: **why is testing so important and why should developers write tests?**

**Writing tests helps you to:**
1. build confidence in how your code works
2. reduce potential bugs & deliver new changes quickly
3. receive instant feedback & catch regression early
4. refactor, deploy and release with higher confidence

**In this module you will:**
- recap core testing concepts (testing pyramid, unit / integration / e2e testing)
- get acquainted with common Node.js testing libraries
- learn how to use Jest as a tool for writing tests
- see examples of unit, integration and e2e tests

Happy learning! 😊
