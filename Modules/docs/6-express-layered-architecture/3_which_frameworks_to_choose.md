# Which frameworks to choose?
Express is not the only framework that we have in Node.js world. There are a lot of them: [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/), [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), [Loopback](https://loopback.io/), [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/), [Hapi.js](https://hapi.dev/), [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), etc.

Below you can see the usage of Node.js frameworks according to [The State of JS](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/):

As you can see, express is still the most popular Node.js framework, despite it being one of the oldest. If we exclude frameworks that are intended for creating server-side rendering servers or any other backend frameworks for fronted (such as Next.js and Gatsby for React, Nuxt for Vue), we will see that Nest.js is the next in the list.

There is a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/VanoDevium/node-framework-stars) that collects information about GitHubâ€™s stars of Node.js frameworks. And Express is number one on this list as well. In the screenshot below you can find the Top 8 Node.js frameworks, the full list is available in the [repository](https://github.com/VanoDevium/node-framework-stars).

You might notice that Nest.js is catching up with Express by the number of stars on GitHub as well. This framework is quite popular today and more and more developers decide to use Nest.js as the main framework for their applications in Epam. The thing is, Nest.js is based on express by default, and having an understanding of Express will help you with learning Nest.js.
